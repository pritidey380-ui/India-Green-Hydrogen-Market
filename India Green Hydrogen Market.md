**Drivers Fueling Green Hydrogen Adoption in India**

Several powerful factors are underpinning India’s green hydrogen ambitions. Foremost among them is the country’s abundant renewable energy resource base. Solar PV and onshore wind — India’s pillars of clean power — are viewed as the backbone for green H₂ production, as many electrolyser projects are planned to co‑locate with renewable farms to minimize energy costs. 
At the same time, technological improvements in electrolyser systems — especially in alkaline and proton-exchange membrane (PEM) technologies — are driving down costs, improving efficiency, and making large-scale green hydrogen production more commercially viable. 

Strong policy support plays a critical role. India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission is a centerpiece of its clean-energy transition. The mission aims to produce 5 million metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, backed by investments and incentives that promote local manufacturing of electrolyser units, pilot plants, and large-scale deployment. 

 Several state governments are also emerging as active partners — for example, Haryana plans 2 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, while other states like Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are positioning themselves as green hydrogen hubs. 

Additionally, India is eyeing export opportunities. The report suggests that by leveraging its renewable capacity and growing electrolyser infrastructure, India could tap into international markets for green hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel. 

**Segmentation: How the Indian Market Is Structured**

Analysis breaks down the Indian green hydrogen market across several dimensions, revealing key strategic insights.

**Plant Capacity**

Projects are categorized by capacity: pilot (< 1 MW), small (1–10 MW), medium (10–50 MW), and large (> 50 MW). Pilot plants serve demonstration purposes and R&D validation, while small-scale facilities cater to industrial clusters. Medium-scale hubs integrate hydrogen production with nearby industries, and large-scale plants are oriented toward industrial offtake or export models. 

**Production Technology**

The report divides production technologies into alkaline electrolysers, PEM, anion-exchange membrane (AEM), solid-oxide electrolysers (SOEC), and others. Alkaline electrolysers dominate in terms of deployment due to their maturity and lower capital costs. 

**Renewable Power Source**

Green hydrogen production in India is primarily powered by solar PV, followed by onshore wind. Solar remains dominant, given India’s strong solar irradiance and falling solar power tariffs. Many green hydrogen projects are being located alongside solar farms to reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). 

Onshore wind plays a growing role, especially in states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. 

**System Ownership Model**

Ownership structures are segmented into captive (owned by a single industrial user), merchant hubs (serving multiple consumers or export), and public–private partnerships (PPP). Captive plants are primarily for decarbonizing internal operations in heavy industries, while merchant hubs and PPP projects are aimed at scale and export. 

**Project Maturity**

Projects are in different maturity stages: concept & feasibility, final investment decision (FID), under construction, and operational. Some hubs are already at FID or under construction, especially in states targeting green hydrogen exports or industrial clusters. 

**End‑User Demand**

End-users are segmented into chemicals & fertilizers, refining & petrochemicals, steel & heavy industry, mobility (road, rail, aviation), and power & utilities. Among these, chemicals and fertilizers (notably for green ammonia) are early adopters, followed by refineries and steel. Mobility and power sector applications are emerging but expected to grow strongly. 

**Challenges and Barriers**

Despite strong tailwinds, India’s green hydrogen market faces non-trivial obstacles. Cost competitiveness is a major issue: green hydrogen currently remains more expensive than grey hydrogen, and until electrolyser manufacturing scales domestically, production costs will stay elevated. 

Infrastructure is another concern — particularly transportation and storage. Hydrogen pipelines are not yet widespread, and storage solutions (compressed, liquified, or via chemical carriers) are still being developed and scaled. 

Offtake risk is yet another challenge. Without long-term commercial agreements, offtake certainty remains limited, which hurts project financing and investor confidence. 

Furthermore, there is no standardized certification or clear mechanism to unambiguously differentiate green hydrogen in trade, making export markets more difficult to navigate. 

**Competitive Landscape**

The Indian green hydrogen ecosystem is already shaping up with a number of industrial heavyweights competing for leadership. NTPC, India’s largest power utility, is building integrated renewable + electrolysis hubs. Reliance Industries is laying out plans for a massive new energy complex in Jamnagar marrying green hydrogen, ammonia, and renewables. Adani Group is leveraging its solar and wind portfolio to host co-located hydrogen plants. 

On the downstream side, companies like Indian Oil, GAIL, and Tata Group are investing in production, blending, transport, and storage technologies. 

Strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and M&A are emerging as key strategies. A number of companies are aligning with state governments, investing in electrolyser manufacturing, or acquiring renewable assets to secure clean hydrogen production capacity and scale. 

Innovation is also central, with firms exploring PEM, alkaline, and even SOEC technologies, along with digital tools like predictive maintenance and AI-based monitoring to optimize hydrogen production. 

Investment Landscape

From an investment perspective, India’s green hydrogen sector presents compelling opportunities. The government-led National Green Hydrogen Mission, with its USD 2.4 billion allocation, provides a strong signal for both domestic and international investors. 

Key investment zones are emerging in states like Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Haryana, which are offering favorable policies, land, and infrastructure to attract large-scale hydrogen projects. 

There is also significant potential for electrolyser manufacturing, green ammonia production, and export-oriented hydrogen hubs, which can tap into growing global demand. 

Export Ambitions

India is positioning itself not just as a domestic producer but also as a global supplier of green hydrogen. The country aims to capture nearly 10% of global green hydrogen demand, tapping export markets in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. 

To realize this ambition, India is developing large-scale merchant hubs, integrating production with renewable energy generation, and exploring partnerships that can ensure hydrogen flows to export markets. 

**Innovation & Technology Readiness**

Technological adaptability is a core strength in India’s green hydrogen strategy. The report notes that companies are pushing advanced technologies — such as PEM and SOEC — while also developing in‑country capability for electrolyser manufacturing, reducing reliance on imports. 

On the storage and transport front, innovative solutions are under development: compressed hydrogen, high-pressure storage, and chemical carriers are being examined to overcome logistical challenges. 

Digital transformation is supporting operational efficiency too; predictive maintenance, AI-enabled monitoring, and smart plant design are being deployed to optimize performance and trim costs. 

**Strategic Implications for Stakeholders**

For industrial adopters — such as steel, fertilizer, and refinery companies — aligning with state and national green hydrogen policies can reduce emissions and secure offtake for long-term, low-carbon hydrogen. For investors, identifying opportunities in electrolyser manufacturing, hydrogen export hubs, and PPP models offers high-growth potential backed by government support. Policymakers can further accelerate growth by standardizing certification, incentivizing pipeline infrastructure, and facilitating export frameworks. Technology providers and OEMs, meanwhile, should focus on localizing electrolyser production, optimizing system integration, and scaling storage solutions to drive down costs and unlock commercial viability.
